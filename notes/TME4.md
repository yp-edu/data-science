# TME4 Notes

## Why Dash

Build interactive, data-driven web apps entirely in Python—no web development stack required.

## Tips & Tricks

- Scripts should be preferred over notebooks, especially when the dashboard gets too complex.
- Prototype quickly: start with a single-page layout and one callback, then iterate.
- Keep callbacks lean and stateless; cache heavy computations or run them asynchronously.
- Modularize by splitting layout and callbacks into separate files/modules for maintainability.
- Containerize (e.g., Docker) and set environment variables for host/port to ease deployment.
