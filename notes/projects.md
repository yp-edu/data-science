- Find your partner ASAP
- Project evaluation throughout all sessions in addition to the final project
- Each course a new notion, no comeback
- Each session applies the course content to first a guided problem (TD) and then your own project (TME)
- Don't expect a detailed correction for each session

## Tips

- Use git from the start ([`git` 101](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) and [GitHub 101](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world))
- Learn to read documentations
- A wide variety of data is available, try to find the most relevant to your problem
- Pre-trained models exist for many tasks and modalities
- Have fun
