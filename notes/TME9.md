## Interpretability: Model Inspection

Some useful resources for understanding model inspection:

- [Interpretable Machine Learning](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/): General overview of interpretability methods for machine learning models.
- [Scikit-learn inspection](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/inspection.html): Documentation for the inspection module of scikit-learn, directly usable on some scikit-learn models.
- [SHAP](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): SHapley Additive exPlanations is a popular library for explaining the output of machine learning models by feature contributions.
- [InterpretML](https://interpret.ml/): InterpretML is a library for designing more interpretable models, it is a standard library in the industry.
- [ML Recipes: Interpretability](https://ml.recipes/notebooks/5-interpretability.html): A notebook from the ML Recipes book, a great resource for understanding interpretability methods in practice.
